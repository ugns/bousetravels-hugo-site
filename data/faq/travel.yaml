- title: Does it cost extra to use a travel agent?
  content: |
    Usually no. Most travel agents are paid by the travel suppliers (like cruise 
    lines or hotels), not by you. Some may charge a planning fee for complex trips, 
    but they’ll always let you know up front.
- title: What are the benefits of using a travel agent?
  content: |
    * Expert advice from someone who knows the industry
    * Time savings—no more endless searching and comparing
    * Exclusive deals and perks you won’t find online
    * Personalized recommendations based on your needs
    * Support before, during, and after your trip
- title: Can I still be involved in the planning?
  content: |
    Absolutely. A travel agent works with you—not instead of you. You can share 
    your research and preferences, and your agent will help fine-tune the details 
    and handle the booking.
- title: What kinds of trips are best to book through a travel agent?
  content: |
    * Cruises
    * Group travel
    * Honeymoons or destination weddings
    * International trips
    * Multi-stop or custom itineraries
    * Luxury or all-inclusive vacations

    For simple flights or hotels, you can book yourself—but even then, an agent 
    may still get you a better rate or bonus.
- title: What happens if something goes wrong on my trip?
  content: |
    If you booked through an agent, you’re not alone. Your agent can help fix 
    issues, rebook canceled flights, deal with travel suppliers, and advocate for 
    refunds or changes.
- title: How do I choose a good travel agent?
  content: |
    Look for someone who:

    * Specializes in the type of travel you want
    * Has good reviews or referrals
    * Communicates clearly and listens to your needs
    * Is transparent about any fees or policies
- title: What if I like booking my own travel online?

    You still can! A good travel agent won’t take over—they’ll enhance what you’re 
    already doing, often with better results and less stress.
