As August approaches, you might be feeling the itch for one last summer adventure before the season slips away. The good news? There’s still time to plan a spontaneous getaway—whether you’re dreaming of a domestic road trip or an international escape. Here’s your guide to the best destinations for a late-summer hurrah and how to snag those coveted last-minute deals.

## Why August is Perfect for a Last-Minute Getaway

August is a sweet spot for travel: crowds begin to thin as families prepare for back-to-school, and many destinations offer end-of-season discounts. The weather is still warm in much of the Northern Hemisphere, making it ideal for both beach escapes and city explorations.

## Top Destinations for Late-Summer Travel

### Domestic Gems

#### 1. **Maine’s Coastal Towns**
With lobster shacks, charming harbors, and cool Atlantic breezes, Maine’s coast is at its best in August. Head to Bar Harbor or Camden for classic New England charm without the early-summer crowds.

#### 2. **Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada**
August brings perfect lake temperatures for swimming, paddleboarding, and boating. The mountain air is crisp, and hiking trails are in full bloom.

#### 3. **Asheville, North Carolina**
Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Asheville offers vibrant arts, farm-to-table dining, and scenic drives along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Late summer means lush greenery and lively festivals.

#### 4. **Door County, Wisconsin**
This Midwest gem is famous for its cherry orchards, lighthouses, and peaceful lakeshore. August is prime time for outdoor concerts and farmers’ markets.

### International Escapes

#### 1. **Portugal’s Algarve Coast**
The Algarve’s golden beaches and dramatic cliffs are still sun-soaked in August, but the crowds start to thin. Enjoy fresh seafood and charming villages at off-peak prices.

#### 2. **Canadian Rockies, Alberta**
Banff and Jasper are stunning in late summer, with wildflowers in bloom and wildlife sightings at their peak. Book a last-minute cabin or lodge for a nature-filled retreat.

#### 3. **Slovenia’s Lake Bled**
This fairytale lake is warm enough for swimming in August, and the surrounding Julian Alps offer endless hiking opportunities. Slovenia remains a budget-friendly European option.

#### 4. **Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast**
August is part of the “green season,” meaning lush rainforests and fewer tourists. Surf towns like Tamarindo and Nosara offer great deals and a laid-back vibe.

## Tips for Scoring the Best Last-Minute Deals

- **Be Flexible:** The more flexible you are with dates and destinations, the better your chances of finding a bargain.
- **Use Deal Aggregators:** Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, and Google Flights are great for spotting last-minute airfare deals.
- **Set Fare Alerts:** Let apps notify you when prices drop for your preferred destinations.
- **Consider Alternative Airports:** Flying into or out of smaller airports can sometimes yield significant savings.
- **Look for Package Deals:** Bundling flights, hotels, and car rentals can unlock extra discounts—check sites like Expedia or Priceline.
- **Travel Midweek:** Tuesdays and Wednesdays often have the lowest fares and hotel rates.
- **Check for End-of-Season Sales:** Many resorts and hotels offer special rates to fill rooms before autumn.

## Final Thoughts

Don’t let summer slip away without one last adventure. With a little flexibility and some savvy searching, you can squeeze in a memorable August getaway—whether it’s a coastal escape, a mountain retreat, or a passport-stamping international trip. Happy travels!
