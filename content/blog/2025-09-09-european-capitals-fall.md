Autumn transforms Europe’s capitals into havens of culture, color, and comfort. With fewer crowds and a golden glow over city parks, it’s the ideal time for a city break. Here’s how to experience Paris, Prague, and Rome at their autumn best.

## Paris, France

Stroll through the Jardin du Luxembourg and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, where leaves turn brilliant shades of red and gold. Sip hot chocolate in a Montmartre café, browse art galleries, and catch the grape harvest festival in Montmartre. Don’t miss Nuit Blanche, the city’s all-night arts festival.

## Prague, Czech Republic

Prague’s medieval streets and castle are especially enchanting in the fall. Enjoy concerts at the Prague Autumn Festival, warm up with mulled wine in Old Town Square, and wander the tree-lined paths of Petřín Hill. Cozy up in a traditional café for apple strudel and views of the Vltava River.

## Rome, Italy

Rome’s ancient ruins and piazzas are bathed in soft autumn light. Visit Villa Borghese gardens, enjoy seasonal dishes like porcini mushrooms and chestnuts, and join locals at the Rome Film Festival. Outdoor terraces and trattorias are perfect for lingering over espresso as the city slows down.

## Tips for a Fall City Break
 - Take advantage of seasonal menus—many restaurants feature limited-time dishes and local specialties.
 - Explore parks and gardens for the best fall foliage photo opportunities.
 - Use public transportation or walk to soak up the city’s atmosphere and avoid traffic.
 - Look for guided walking tours focused on history, food, or art to deepen your experience.
