Fall in the American Southwest is a season of transformation. As summer’s heat fades, the desert comes alive with color, festivals, and outdoor adventures. Whether you’re drawn to red rock canyons, vibrant art scenes, or star-filled skies, autumn is the perfect time to explore Sedona, Santa Fe, and Moab.

## Sedona, Arizona

Sedona’s iconic red rocks glow even brighter in the crisp autumn light. Hike scenic trails like Cathedral Rock and Bell Rock, or take a jeep tour through Oak Creek Canyon. The town’s art galleries and wellness retreats offer a relaxing counterpoint to outdoor exploration. Don’t miss the Sedona Arts Festival and the chance to stargaze under some of the clearest skies in the country.

## Santa Fe, New Mexico

Santa Fe blends Native American, Spanish, and Anglo cultures in a city renowned for its art, cuisine, and history. Fall brings the Santa Fe Wine & Chile Fiesta, harvest markets, and golden aspens in the nearby mountains. Explore the historic Plaza, visit world-class museums, and savor local dishes like green chile stew. The city’s adobe architecture and vibrant festivals make it a photographer’s dream.

## Moab, Utah

Moab is a gateway to Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, where cooler temperatures make hiking and biking a pleasure. Autumn’s low angle sunlight turns the landscape into a canvas of reds, oranges, and golds. Join a guided rafting trip on the Colorado River, or attend the Moab Music Festival for concerts set against dramatic canyon backdrops. Camp under the stars or relax in a cozy lodge after a day of adventure.

- Book accommodations early—fall is a popular season.
- Pack layers for chilly mornings and warm afternoons.
- Respect local cultures and natural environments.
