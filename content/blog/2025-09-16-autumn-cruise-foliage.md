Autumn is the perfect season to cruise through landscapes ablaze with color. Whether you prefer the gentle pace of a river cruise or the grandeur of the open ocean, these routes offer the best of fall foliage and seasonal charm.

## River Cruises: Danube & Rhine

**Danube River:** Sail from Vienna to Budapest, passing through Wachau Valley vineyards and medieval towns. Enjoy onboard wine tastings, guided hikes, and local harvest festivals. The riverbanks glow with gold and crimson as the season peaks.

**Rhine River:** Cruise from Amsterdam to Basel, with stops in Cologne, Strasbourg, and the storybook castles of the Rhine Gorge. Autumn markets, vineyard tours, and scenic bike rides make this a favorite for leaf-peepers.

## Ocean Cruises: Canada & New England

**Canada’s Maritime Provinces:** Explore Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island as forests turn fiery red and orange. Ports like Halifax and Charlottetown host fall festivals and seafood feasts.

**New England Coast:** Sail from Boston to Bar Harbor, visiting Cape Cod, Newport, and Portland. The coastline is lined with lighthouses, historic towns, and forests at their autumn peak. Enjoy lobster bakes, hiking, and local art walks.
