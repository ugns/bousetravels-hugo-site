Autumn is a magical time for wine lovers, as vineyards around the world burst into color and the air fills with the excitement of harvest. While Napa and Tuscany are perennial favorites, this season is perfect for exploring lesser-known wine regions that shine in the fall.

## Napa Valley, California

Experience the grape harvest with hands-on tours, wine tastings, and vineyard picnics. The valley’s golden vines and crisp mornings set the stage for events like the Calistoga Harvest Table and St. Helena’s Crush.

## Tuscany, Italy

Savor Chianti and Brunello in the rolling hills of Tuscany. Autumn brings grape picking, truffle festivals, and rustic feasts in medieval towns. Don’t miss the grape-stomping traditions and local sagre (food fairs).

## Bordeaux, France

Bordeaux’s harvest season is celebrated with wine festivals, cellar tours, and tastings of world-class reds. Explore the city’s historic architecture, stroll the vineyards of Saint-Émilion, and enjoy seasonal cuisine in cozy bistros.

## Douro Valley, Portugal

The Douro Valley’s terraced hillsides glow with fall colors as grapes are handpicked for port and table wines. Take a river cruise, visit quintas (wine estates), and sample fresh grape juice alongside aged ports.

## Mendoza, Argentina

In the shadow of the Andes, Mendoza’s harvest is a lively affair. Tour Malbec vineyards, join harvest parties, and enjoy asado (barbecue) under the stars. The region’s wine roads are lined with golden poplars and mountain views.

- Dress in layers for cool mornings and warm afternoons.
- Look for local harvest festivals and food pairings.
