The week between Christmas and New Year’s—often called “Twixmas”—is an underrated travel window. Many people stay close to home, so destinations that are usually crowded can feel quieter. It’s the perfect time for a short, restorative break before the New Year’s whirlwind.

## What Makes a Great Twixmas Trip?

Look for places that offer relaxation, low-key activities, and easy logistics: short flights or drives, comfortable accommodations, and plenty of options for cozy dining or gentle outdoor pursuits.

## Short & Relaxing Twixmas Ideas

**Cozy Cabin Retreats**
- Rent a cabin near a lake or in the woods—think quiet trails, fireplaces, and long walks. Regions like the Poconos, Adirondacks, or the Catskills offer proximity to major metro areas with a slower pace.

**Spa & Wellness Weekends**
- Book a boutique spa resort for massages, saunas, and healthy cuisine. Many resorts offer Twixmas packages with yoga classes and detox menus.

**Cultural City Stops**
- Choose smaller cities known for museums and food—places like Savannah, GA, or Santa Fe, NM, provide quiet streets, excellent dining, and cultural attractions without the high holiday crowds.

**Short Coastal Escapes**
- Off-season coastal towns are restful at this time—walk beaches, visit lighthouses, and enjoy out-of-season rates in places like Myrtle Beach, SC, or Cape Cod, MA.

## Planning Tips

- Book refundable or flexible rates when possible—plans may change around the holidays.
- Pack layers: weather can vary widely between regions.
- Make one or two reservations (dinner, spa treatment) to anchor your trip but leave room for spontaneity.
