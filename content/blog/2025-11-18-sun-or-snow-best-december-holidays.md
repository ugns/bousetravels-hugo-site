December offers two very different kinds of holiday magic: the classic white-blanket romance of snow-covered towns and the laid-back allure of sun-drenched escapes. Both can create unforgettable memories—your choice depends on the vibe you crave, the activities you enjoy, and who you’re traveling with. Here’s how to weigh the options and pick the perfect December destination.

## The Case for Snow: Classic Winter Holidays

There’s something timeless about a snowy holiday. Think overstuffed coats, streets lit with warm lamps, steaming mugs of cider, and the soft hush of falling snow. If your holiday ideal includes skating under twinkling lights, cozy fireside meals, and traditional markets, snow wins.

Top snowy picks:
- **Quebec City, Canada:** Historic Old Town becomes a storybook setting with narrow streets, festive markets, and French-Canadian holiday traditions.
- **Aspen, Colorado:** Ski slopes, luxury lodges, and a lively town scene make Aspen a great option for winter sports lovers and luxury travelers alike.
- **Rovaniemi, Finland:** For a bucket-list white Christmas, visit Santa Claus Village and chase the Northern Lights in Lapland.

Why choose snow:
- Seasonal activities: skiing, snowshoeing, sledding, and winter festivals.
- Iconic atmosphere: markets, carols, and decorations that feel quintessentially holiday.
- Cozy experiences: spas, cabin stays, and long dinners by the fire.

Tips for snowy travel:
- Book accommodations and ski passes early—December can sell out in popular resorts.
- Pack warm layers, waterproof boots, and hand warmers.
- Plan for slower transport times—allow buffer days for weather-related delays.

## The Case for Sun: Warm-Weather Escapes

If your idea of a holiday includes palm trees, sunrise swims, and outdoor dining without a heavy coat, a tropical or sun-drenched escape is the better pick. Winter sun destinations offer relaxation, outdoor adventure, and a break from the cold back home.

Top sunny picks:
- **Hawaii (Maui or Kauai):** Warm ocean, whale-watching season (December onward in some regions), and lush scenery.
- **Canary Islands, Spain:** Mild temperatures, volcanic landscapes, and beaches that feel a world away without a long-haul flight from Europe.
- **Riviera Maya, Mexico:** Beach resorts, cenote explorations, and cultural visits to Tulum or Chichén Itzá.

Why choose sun:
- Weather certainty: fewer weather delays and more predictable outdoor activities.
- Outdoor leisure: snorkeling, hiking, and beachside relaxation.
- Family-friendly: easier logistics for families with young children who prefer milder climates.

Tips for warm-weather travel:
- Check for seasonal events and peak times—some tropical spots fill up around the holidays.
- Pack reef-safe sunscreen and lightweight layers for cooler evenings.
- Book activities like snorkeling and guided tours in advance.

## Hybrid Options: Best of Both Worlds

Not sure which to choose? Consider destinations that offer mild winters and festive charm: southern European cities (Lisbon, Seville), parts of California (Palm Springs), or coastal New England towns with maritime winter festivals. These places often have holiday decorations and cultural programming without deep freezes.

## Decision Checklist

- Do you want active outdoor sports (skiing) or lazy beach days?
- Are you traveling with young children, older relatives, or a large group requiring easier logistics?
- Is weather reliability or traditional holiday ambiance more important to you?
- What’s your budget? Peak-season pricing can be high for both ski resorts and sunny beach destinations.
