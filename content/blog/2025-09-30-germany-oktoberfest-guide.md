Oktoberfest is more than just a beer festival—it’s a celebration of Bavarian culture, music, and community. While Munich’s legendary event draws millions, you’ll find authentic Oktoberfest celebrations across Germany and around the world. Here’s how to make the most of Oktoberfest season, whether you’re heading to Munich or seeking great alternatives closer to home.

## Oktoberfest in Munich

Held from late September to the first weekend in October, Munich’s Oktoberfest is the world’s largest folk festival. The Theresienwiese fairgrounds transform into a wonderland of beer tents, carnival rides, and traditional music. Locals and visitors don dirndls and lederhosen, raising steins to the sounds of oompah bands. Don’t miss the ceremonial keg tapping, hearty Bavarian fare (think pretzels, roast chicken, and sausages), and the family-friendly parades.
